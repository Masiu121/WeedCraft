 - 3 Types of weed available
    - Amnesia haze
    - Lemon haze
    - Purple haze

## Quick how-to

Break grass and tall grass to obtain weed seeds. There is 0.2% chance that the seeds will drop and then mod randomly chooses which type of seeds will drop depending on their chances.

 > Amnesia haze - 20%<br>
 > Purple haze - 30%<br>
 > Lemon haze - 50%

To grow weed, you gonna need a pot. After crafting it, right-click it with seeds in hand to plant weed. You can set the growing light 2 blocks above pot to increase growing speed. After your weed is fully grown, right-click pot with scissors to receive one plant of weed, but drop of seeds is not guaranteed. Chance for dropping seeds from fully grown plant is base chance of seed drop times 1.5.

To get flowers and leaves from your plant, you gonna need a hook. Place it on the ceiling and right-click it with plant in your hand to hang you plant on it. After some time, right-click it with scissors and you will get leaf and flowers. You can grind the flower with grinder then, and craft some joints to smoke.
